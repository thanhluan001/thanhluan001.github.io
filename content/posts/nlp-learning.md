## Getting Data

We're using "Disasters in Social Media" dataset which consists  of tweet archive where 

> Over 10,000 tweets culled with a variety of 
> searches like “ablaze”, “quarantine”, and “pandemonium”, then 
> noted whether the tweet referred to a disaster event (as opposed 
> to a joke with the word or a movie review or something 
> non-disastrous).

The objective is to distinguish between tweets that signal disasters and "irrelevant" tweets.
